				<span class="tab0"></span><b><i>Jorge A. Santiago</i></b> is a tenth grader at the University of Puerto Rico High School. He is a responsible and hardworking student. Jorge is also part of the Advanced Mathematics (he has great interest in this subject), Advanced English, and Advanced Science courses.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<span class="tab0"></span>Since Jorge was a little kid, he loved the idea of being an engineer or programmer and working on creating robots or gadgets. His dream began after watching the movie Iron Man; watching how the protagonist (Tony Stark) assembled and built his own armor was amazing. It really filled him with joy and a desire to dedicate himself to it in the future. He has loved the experience so far in the Robotics Club. The "trial and error" process was really amazing for him because he always learned something new from the experience. Slowly but surely he has been learning and contributing more to the team. In addition, he expects to get far in these competitions with his team and to learn a lot. He is sure that this experience will help him strive in the future.

She is currently coursing advanced mathematics and English. As for affiliations with school organizations, she has been in UHS's volleyball team since seventh grade and has also been in Art Club and Confra, a Christian support group. She had heard about Robotics before but she didn't get to join until tenth grade.
				<br>
				<br>
				<span class="tab0">As previously stated, she had been in robotics since the beginning of tenth grade. With the help of people who knew about robotics she has been able to form part of the team 2223-Z.  This club wasn't much what she expected.  It isn't simply building a robot, you also have to work together, form strategies and do other things such as the engineering notebook, etc.

						<span class="tab0"></span> <b><i>Daniela M&#233ndez Marxuach</i></b> is currently an
				<br> eleventh grader in the University of Puerto Rico High School. She likes the fine arts area (specifically for music and plastic arts) and she likes STEM subjects. She is in the advanced courses of English, science, and has completed her advanced mathematics courses.
				<br>
				<br>
				<span class="tab0"></span>She developed an interest in computer science during the summer of 2016 in a cybersecurity camp. Since then she's gained a heavy fixation for the world of technology. By the end of last November, her classmate, Marcos Pesante, invited her to a robotics club reunion and, assisting with his team's robot, she learned of a hidden ability of hers for mechanics. Since then she has involved herself in the team 2223-Z and joined the UHS Robotics Club.
				<br>
				<br>
				<span class="tab0"></span>Daniela has dabbled in programming and driving the robot, but she mostly dedicates herself to mechanics. Her experience with robotics thus far has been excellent and she plans to continue as an active member in the club until she graduates in May of 2018. She is also the vice president of the Computer Club and participates in Art Club.

				<span class="tab0"></span><b><i>Marcos R. Pesante Col&#243n</i></b> is a tenth-grade student at the University of Puerto Rico High School. Presently he is a part of the advanced courses in mathematics, English, and science, and other than being a member of the Robotics Club he is also the secretary of the UHS Computer Club. He is the main programmer of 2223-Z and this is his second year that he participates in VRC (after Skyrise in 2014-2015). Initially he did not like STEM at all, he only liked art (especially origami) and he wanted to grow more in this area. In the summer of 2014 he wanted to participate in a photography camp, but because of the lack of registration he ended up participating in the robotics one. An interest in mathematics, science, engineering and especially technology (STEM) flourished in him thanks to this camp. Combined with a desire for knowledge, this newfound passion helped Marcos learn and grow more in the STEM area and, for this purpose, to participate in VRC to continue learning through practice.
